            <p>
                Our email analytics service at <b>insightbox.xyz</b> is
                committed to the privacy and security of the information that we
                collect, process, analyse and store from our users when using
                our application. This policy outlines what data we collect from
                our users, how we use it and the current security of the site.

                We may change this policy over time, ensure to check back every

            <h2>What data we collect</h2>
            <p>
                We collect a user's Google account information to sign up and
                create an account on the system for the user.
            </p>
            <p>
                When processing and displaying insights and analytics on a
                user's Gmail inbox, we retrieve email metadata such as:{" "}
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Subject Title</li>
                <li>Time sent/received</li>
                <li>Recipient information</li>
                <li>Sender information</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How we collect this data</h2>
            <p>
                When a user signs up with their Google account, we use Google's
                API to retrieve their data securely using the OAuth 2.0
                protocol. Authorised requests are then sent to the user's Gmail
                account to retrieve email metadata of the user's inbox.
            </p>
